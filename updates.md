:white_check_mark: Completed Steps

1. Project Setup

   - Created file structure
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Installed packages (ChromaDB, PyPDF2, etc.)

2. Data Collection

   - MITRE ATT&CK: Downloaded enterprise-attack.json

:white_check_mark: Completed Steps

1. **Agent System Architecture**

   - **Agent State Management**: Created TypeDict structure for tracking workflow state (queries, responses, context, confidence scores)
   - **Specialized Tools**: Implemented LangChain tools for domain-specific knowledge base searching

2. **Agent Implementations**

   - **Specialized Agents**: Built three expert agents:
     - `IncidentResponseAgent` - Containment, investigation, recovery procedures
     - `ThreatIntelligenceAgent` - IOCs, TTPs, attribution analysis
     - `PreventionAgent` - Security frameworks, proactive measures, risk mitigation
   - **LLM Integration**: Each agent uses ChatGPT-4o-mini with specialized system prompts

3. **Routing & Workflow System**

   - **Router Agent**: Intelligent query classification system
   - **LangGraph Workflow**: StateGraph orchestration with conditional routing to specialists

4. **Vector Store Enhancements**
   - **HuggingFace Integration**: Updated to use BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 model
   - **CUDA Optimization**: Added GPU detection and batch processing
   - **Agent-Type Filtering**: Enhanced search with metadata filtering for agent-specific knowledge retrieval

:arrows_counterclockwise: Changed

- **Embedding System**: Migrated from OpenAI embeddings to HuggingFace for completely local processing

Next Steps

- Build web interface for agent interaction
- Implement conversation memory and multi-turn dialogue
- Add agent performance monitoring and analytics
- Create API endpoints for agent services

Stay tuned
