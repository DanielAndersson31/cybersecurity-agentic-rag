:white_check_mark: Completed Steps

1. **Agent System Architecture**

   - **Agent State Management**: Created TypeDict structure for tracking workflow state (queries, responses, context, confidence scores)
   - **Specialized Tools**: Implemented LangChain tools for domain-specific knowledge base searching

2. **Agent Implementations**

   - **Specialized Agents**: Built three expert agents:
     - `IncidentResponseAgent` - Containment, investigation, recovery procedures
     - `ThreatIntelligenceAgent` - IOCs, TTPs, attribution analysis
     - `PreventionAgent` - Security frameworks, proactive measures, risk mitigation
   - **LLM Integration**: Each agent uses ChatGPT-4o-mini with specialized system prompts

3. **Routing & Workflow System**

   - **Router Agent**: Intelligent query classification system
   - **LangGraph Workflow**: StateGraph orchestration with conditional routing to specialists

4. **Vector Store Enhancements**
   - **HuggingFace Integration**: Updated to use BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 model
   - **CUDA Optimization**: Added GPU detection and batch processing
   - **Agent-Type Filtering**: Enhanced search with metadata filtering for agent-specific knowledge retrieval

:arrows_counterclockwise: Changed

- **Embedding System**: Migrated from OpenAI embeddings to HuggingFace for completely local processing

Next Steps

- Build web interface for agent interaction
- Implement conversation memory and multi-turn dialogue
- Add agent performance monitoring and analytics
- Create API endpoints for agent services

:white_check_mark: Completed Steps

1. **Conversation Memory & Multi-turn Dialogue**

   - **State Management**: Enhanced AgentState with conversation history tracking and session management
   - **Persistent Storage**: Implemented SQLite checkpointing for conversation persistence across sessions
   - **Follow-up Detection**: Router now detects and handles follow-up questions intelligently
   - **Context-Aware Agents**: All specialist agents now consider conversation history in responses

2. **Enhanced Agent Architecture**

   - **Message Integration**: Migrated to LangGraph's built-in message handling system
   - **Conversation Flow**: Agents automatically maintain conversation context between interactions
   - **Session Support**: Added session-based conversation tracking with unique identifiers

:arrows_counterclockwise: Changed

- **Agent Processing**: Evolved from stateless to stateful agents with conversation awareness
- **Data Persistence**: Replaced in-memory storage with SQLite-based conversation persistence

Next Steps

- Implement enhanced CLI with conversation history commands
- Add conversation analytics and session management features
- Build web interface for multi-session agent interaction
- Add conversation export and import functionality

Agents related stuff to add:

- Websearch
- Confidence Score/Metric
- Context Manager
- ~~Conversation Memory(History)~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Multi-turn dialogue ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Mutli-agent dialogue (Agents collaboration)

- Hybrid Retrieval system - BM25 Keyword search, reranking models to combine semantic + keyword results, metadata filtering improvements
- Advanced chunking srategy - Replace basic RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with
  - Semantic chunking that respects document structure
  - Overlapping context windwos with intelligent boundaries
  - Chunk metadata enrichment
  - Multi-level chunking (summary + detail chunk)
- RAG Evaluation - RAGAS? Faithfulness, answer relevanc and hallucation detection
- Advanced agent collaboration
  - Multi--agent workflow where agents consult eachother
  - Confidence based routing, routing to mutliple agents if confidence is low
  - Expoert system integration for complex decision trees
  - Automated escaltion to human experts

Stay tuned
